This code aims to improve garbage classifier using VGG-16 transfer learning by creating a model from the photographs in the dataset.
The data set should be extracted from the .rar file and placed in a file that the code can extract.
When the code runs, it runs the test.py codes using the model.h5 file it trained and tests the results according to this learning percentage. 
Test_picture.py presents them to us in a visual format.
